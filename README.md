## Abstract

ERC-7629, known as the Unified Token Protocol, introduces a comprehensive protocol unifying the characteristics of ERC-721 and ERC-20 tokens within the Ethereum ecosystem. This standard seamlessly integrates the liquidity features of ERC-20 with the non-fungible nature of ERC-721, enabling frictionless conversion between these asset types. ERC-7629 offers a multifunctional solution, providing developers and users with the flexibility to leverage both liquidity and non-fungibility in a unified token framework.

## Motivation

The motivation behind ERC-7629 stems from the inherent need within the blockchain community for assets that possess both the liquidity of ERC-20 tokens and the non-fungibility of ERC-721 tokens. Current standards present a dichotomy, necessitating users to choose between these features. ERC-7629 addresses this limitation by providing a unified token standard, empowering users to seamlessly transition between ERC-20 and ERC-721 characteristics, catering to diverse blockchain applications.
